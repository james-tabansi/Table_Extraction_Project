# Table_Extraction_Project
## Project Scope and Objectives
- The goal of this project is to build an application to extract tables from a PDF (Portable Document Format) document and use and LLM to answer questions based on the extracted data.

## Methodology
- Step1: PDF Parsing and Table Extraction.
  - PDF Parsing: This is used to describe the process of converting the contents of a PDF into a structured format that can be processed and understood by a computer. We will use the PDF parsing library 'PyPDF2' to extract the text and structure from the PDF document.
